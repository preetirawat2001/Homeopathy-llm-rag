# Homeopathy-llm-rag

A symptom-based Homeopathy chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses FAISS for similarity search over Phatak Materia Medica and TinyLlama to generate answers. Powered by MiniLM embeddings and served through Gradio.

## üéØ Objective

To help users find relevant homeopathic remedies by querying symptoms and receiving contextually generated answers from a local LLM.

## üìö Data Source

- **Phatak Materia Medica**
- Converted to structured JSON with:
  - `medicine`
  - `symptoms`
  - `description`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Load `phatak.json` containing homeopathy knowledge
2. Convert each medicine's data to text chunks
3. Generate dense embeddings using MiniLM
4. Store & index these embeddings using FAISS
5. Accept user symptom query via Gradio UI
6. Retrieve most similar entries using FAISS
7. Pass results to TinyLlama LLM via HuggingFace `pipeline`
8. Display generated answer in the chatbot interface

- "Remedy for sore throat with cough"
- "What is the treatment for acidity and indigestion?"
- "Tell me about symptoms of Nux Vomica"
